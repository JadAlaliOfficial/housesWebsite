# Houses Website

A web application designed to manage and track user progress through various stages, likely related to a house purchasing or building process. It features dynamic content management for stages and rich text editing capabilities.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend**: Laravel
*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
*   **Build Tool**: Vite
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **Rich Text Editor**: QuillEditor

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the key directories:

*   `app/`: Contains the core code of your Laravel application (Models, Controllers, Services, etc.).
*   `config/`: Stores all of your application's configuration files.
*   `database/`: Contains your database migrations, model factories, and seeds.
*   `public/`: The web server's document root. Contains the `index.php` entry point and compiled assets.
*   `resources/js/`: Contains your React/TypeScript frontend source code.
*   `resources/views/`: Contains your Blade templates (though primarily using React for the frontend).
*   `routes/`: Defines all the web and API routes for your application.
*   `storage/`: Contains compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. `storage/app/public` is often used for user-uploaded files.
*   `tests/`: Contains your automated tests.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd housesWebsite
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Laravel)**:
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
        ```bash
        copy .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Configure your database connection and other environment variables in `.env`.
    *   Install PHP dependencies:
        ```bash
        composer install
        ```
    *   Generate an application key:
        ```bash
        php artisan key:generate
        ```
    *   Run database migrations:
        ```bash
        php artisan migrate
        ```
    *   (Optional) Seed the database:
        ```bash
        php artisan db:seed
        ```
    *   Link the storage directory:
        ```bash
        php artisan storage:link
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (React/TypeScript with Vite)**:
    *   Install Node.js dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

4.  **Running the Application**:
    *   Start the Laravel development server (usually on port 8000):
        ```bash
        php artisan serve
        ```
    *   Start the Vite development server for frontend hot-reloading (usually on port 5173):
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   Access the application in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:8000` (if Laravel serves the main views) or `http://localhost:5173` (if Vite serves directly during development, depending on setup).

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Stage Management**: Stages (steps in a process) are managed dynamically from the backend, allowing for easy updates without code changes. This includes stage order, names, titles, descriptions, images, and button links.
*   **User Progress Tracking**: The dashboard displays user status with clear visual cues (e.g., 'done', 'on hold', 'Not Requested') using color codes.
*   **Rich Text Editing**: Utilizes QuillEditor for creating and editing content for stage descriptions and popups, allowing for formatted text.
*   **Component-Based Frontend**: Built with React and TypeScript, promoting reusable UI components.
*   **Modern Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling.
